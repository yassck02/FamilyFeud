New in binutils-20080624-2
Refresh from CVS.  Add a bugfix patch from Alan Modra for a problem
discovered by Yaakov Selkowitz. This corrects a problem with
"nm -C" not removing leading underscores.

Refresh from CVS.

New in 20050813-1:
Refresh from CVS to pick up a fix for ld which caused a section in the Cygwin
DLL to be incorrectly sized.

New in 20050610-1:
Refresh from CVS to pick up a fix for ld which
caused it to keep too many file descriptors open.

Also includes a minor patch to make sure that dlls which use auto-image
base do not tromp on the cygwin DLL.

New in 20050608-1:
Fix problem with noload (usually debug) sections which are actually
loaded into memory by Windows.

New in 20050520-1:
Standard refresh.  Seems to fix a strip SEGV caused by trying to strip
an archive file which contains an archive file.  Also contains a
dlltool patch from Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes to fix problems with
dlltool and CRs in input files.

New in 20041229-1:
Refreshed to grab Danny Smith's change which allows specifying console
mode when building dlls.

New in 20041228-1
Standard refresh.

A notable patch:

New in 20040725-2
Make --enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc the default again.

New in 20040725-1
Standard refresh.

Adds weak symbols for dlls, courtesy of Aaron W. LaFramboise.
Dwarf2 support is now possible for binutils.  gdb and gcc should
follow soon.

New in 20040302-1
Just a refresh.

Fixes for dllwrap and autoimport.
dlltool now creates temporary files which will not collide with
other simultaneous uses.

New in 20030901-1
Just a refresh.

Notable changes:

Adds the ability to use exports from an executable and the ability to
create a separate file holding debug info.

Fixed dlltool so that the tmp files it creates are unique, allowing
"make -jN" to operate successfully when building import libraries.

libcygwin.a is treated as a "special" library so that globals from this
library are not reexported.

New in 20030307-1:
Just a refresh from sources.redhat.com with one minor change from Chuck Wilson
to make the --enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc the default.

New in 20021117-1:

A refresh from sources.redhat.com.
A notable change is the addition of Egor Duda's --enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc
option which allows almost transparent linking of dll's without the need
of an import file.

New in 20021107-1:

A refresh from sources.redhat.com.

Also, uses 128 bit alignment which is apparently required for Java.

New in 20020826-1:

Just a refresh from sources.redhat.com.

New in 20020706-2:

Fastcall support from Eric Kohl.

New in 20020706-1:

Removed experimental increased default alignment from coff-i386.c.
This caused strange problems running constructors.

This document is just a place to keep track of various issues
related to the '--enable-auto-import' feature of recent
(20010802 and newer) binutils on cygwin.

Quoting from various mail messages:

Default handling of --enable-auto-import has changed slightly.  In the
earlier cygwin release of binutils, --enable-auto-import was the
default, and ld would issue warnings whenever variables from DLLs were
auto-imported.  Also, in the past if you explicitly specified
"--enable-auto-import", the behavior was the same: auto-import was
activated, and warnings were generated.

In this new release, auto-import is still enabled by default.  Whenever
variables from DLLs are auto-imported, ld issues an info_msg (not a
warning).  However, if you explicitly specify "--enable-auto-import",
then those info_msgs are suppressed.

   * pe-dll.cc (autofilter_symbolprefixlist): don't export
      reimported functions.

from ld.texinfo

@kindex --exclude-libs
@item --exclude-libs @var{lib},@var{lib},...
Specifies a list of archive libraries from which symbols should not be
automatically
exported. The library names may be delimited by commas or colons.  Specifying
@code{--exclude-libs ALL} excludes symbols in all archive libraries from
automatic export. Symbols explicitly listed in a .def file are still exported,
regardless of this option.

Two other fixes in official sources, from ReactOs group:

Many fixes to windres, specifically to dialog boxes and menus.

The addition of checksums to pe headers.

Plus, of course various and sundry binutils changes from Nick Clifton and
other binutils maintainers.
