========================================================================
The zlib compression library provides in-memory compression and
decompression functions, including  integrity checks of the uncompressed
data.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-1.7.5-1

Build requirements:
  cygwin-1.7.5-1
  gcc4-core-4.3.4-3
  binutils-2.20.51-2
  make-3.81-2
  cygport-0.9.85-1

Canonical download:

License:
  The zlib/libpng license (permissive, non-copyleft)

Language:
  C, asm
  
========================================================================

Build instructions:
  unpack zlib-1.2.5-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport zlib-1.2.5-X all

This will create:
  /usr/src/zlib-1.2.5-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/zlib0-1.2.5-X.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/zlib-devel-1.2.5-X-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/zlib-1.2.5-X-src.tar.bz2

========================================================================

To link this library with your projects:
  #1) include zlib.h and zconf.h
  #2) to link with the static library, use '-static' on the link line 
  #3) to link with the dll, no unusual link-time flags are needed.
In either case, there are NO special compile time flags needed

1.2.3-1: routine update

1.2.2-2: bug fix release
  * fixes security issue can-2005-2096

1.2.2-1: Routine upgrade
  * includes security fix below

1.2.1-2: Security fix
  http://lwn.net/Articles/99288/

1.2.1-1: Bump to official release

1.2.0.7-2: Incorporate comments from Cosmin Truta

1.2.0.7-1: update to 1.2.0.7 beta release.  Compiled against 
           cygwin-1.5.5

1.2.0.3-1: update to 1.2.0.3 beta release.  Compiled against 
           cygwin-1.5.1

1.2.0.1-1: update to 1.2.0.1 beta release.  Compiled against
           cygwin-1.5.0

1.1.4-1: update to 1.1.4 release.  1.1.4 fixes a double-free
  error that could cause heap corruption.

1.1.3-7: no more need for -DZLIB_STATIC/-DALL_STATIC; now use
  auto-import functionality.

1.1.3-6: Added -DALL_STATIC synonym for -DZLIB_STATIC

As of 1.1.3-5, the dll is named "cygz.dll" NOT "libz.dll".  This 
  helps to avoid dll naming conflicts between cygwin dll's and 
  dlls from other platforms (native, pw, etc).  If you have an
  executable that depends on "libz.dll" you may either recompile 
  your app so that it links with libz.dll.a/cygz.dll, or install
  *just* the dll from zlib-1.1.3-4.tar.gz into your /usr/bin 
  directory.

The dll is NOT versioned. (i.e. "cygz.dll" NOT "cygz1.dll") because
  the libz package and interface is quite stable, and its interface
  is not anticipated to change in the foreseeable future.

OS_TYPE is unix (0x03) not Win9x/NT (0x0b)

All #ifdef (WIN32) statements are guarded with '&& !(__CYGWIN__)' or 
  expanded with '|| (__CYGWIN__)' as appropriate. So, the cygwin 
  version should work whether 'WIN32' is defined or not (e.g.
  whether '-mwin32' is used or not)

Binary package does NOT include the 586 or 686 optimized assembler
  code. See Makefile.in for instructions on how to enable 
  assembler optimizations.

Most of the patches in zlib-1.1.3-X.patch have been submitted to 
  zlib. Since Jean-loup Gailly seems to be MIA, the other maintainer
  of zlib, Greg Roelofs, has placed a cygwin patch in the 'contrib'
  directory of the ftp site: 
    ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/contrib
  The patch in that contrib directory contains most of the important
  parts of this patch. However, until an official zlib-1.1.4 is
  released with those changes included, cygwin-zlib will be 
  distributed with a patch against a 'clean' zlib-1.1.3 and thus 
  will duplicate the changes in the patches Greg has accepted.
